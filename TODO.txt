Game:
- Bub and Bob can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps.
- Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling
- If a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top.
- Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance.
- The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them within a set amount of time.
- Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points.
- If the player takes too long to burst the bubble, the enemy pops out of it again.
- All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.
- A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles.
- A player has 4 lives
- There are two types of enemies:
  * Maita - which looks like a ghost and throws boulders (https://bubblebobble.fandom.com/wiki/Maita (Links to an external site.))
  * Zen-Chan - which can jump on or charge at the player (https://bubblebobble.fandom.com/wiki/Zen-chan (Links to an external site.))
- When a Zen-Chan dies, a watermelon spawns awarding 100 points
- When a Maita dies, french fries spawn awarding 200 points
- Implement at least three levels, these must be loaded from a file. At least one level has gaps at the bottom edge.
- There must be three game modes:
  * Single player (Bob)
  * Co-op (Bob and Bub)
  * Versus - here one player plays as Bob and one player as a Maita.
- Players can play with keyboard and controller
