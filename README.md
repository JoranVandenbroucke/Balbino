En Debug hapens all the magic

new, controller?
hop over to edit. select your controller and edit it

don't like a level?
go to the Level Game Object and nudge the slider

everything, within the limits of my components, is posible

the game itself has some extras

I am placing this here because I think (I know) that I will have forgotten places where I have to say from where I have the code so I am going to do it general here.

A LOT OF CODE THAT I USE IS OR DIRECTLY FROM THE UNITY3D ENGENE AND THAN CONVERTED TO C++, INSPIRED BY https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference OR INSPIRED BY THERE PROJECT FILES (PROJECT >> ASSETS >> OPEN UNITY FILE WITH NOTEPAD)

SOME OF THE CODE IS ALSO BASED OFF THE IMGUI DEMO FILES
